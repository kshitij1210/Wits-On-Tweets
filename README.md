Sentiment Analysis of Tweets giving positive or negative sentiment

##Motivation

In all our daily lives we take decisions which are highly motivated by people around us. Nowadays the decisions we take are not only dependent on the reviews of people closest to us, but also on the reviews from everyone around the globe. Websites like Twitter, Facebook help us to quickly gather a lot of information about any particular topic. Our project aims to help individuals gather live information about any topic on Twitter based on any keyword and predict the sense of the tweets to make better real-time decisions.

##What We Did

We implemented a model that can accurately classify Twitter messages as positive or negative based on probabilities. Our hypothesis is that we can obtain high accuracy on classifying sentiment in Twitter messages using deep learning techniques.

##Our Result

We compared two different approaches to tackle sentiment analysis problem using Neural Networks. Of the two models we implemented, both the accuracy are comparable. We achieved 77.7% accuracy in case of Feed Forward with Backpropagation model and a slightly less 76.5% accuracy in case of RNN-LSTM. It was noticed that increasing the size of the dataset and the number of words included in the dictionary also increases our accuracy. But due to the hardware re-strictions, this was the maximum accuracy achieved.
